# Tak and the Power of Juju Bingo

This is a custom set of Bingo goals for use with Lockout Live. In the .zip file, there are 2 bingo saves that can be imported into Dolphin. There are currently 108 goals that are likely not very balanced. The board and line categories are separated by goal-type and area, which probably is not the best way to categorize them. I'd be happy to revisit the categorizations and goals once I get a better understanding of how the bingo boards play out. I mostly created this bingo board to give some more replayability to Tak for anyone who is interested.

This bingo is intended to either be played from 1 of the 2 included save files, or from a fresh file. There are only 3 goals currently that require access to Chicken Temple, and these can be excluded by excluding the **post100yorbels** category when setting up your Bingo game in lockout.live. There are currently no goals that require access to Tlaloc.

If you have any questions, you can send me a DM on Discord or leave a comment on my bingo setup video. Rinizur is my username on Discord. Enjoy this new game mode for Tak :)

## Quickstart Guide:

**Lockout.Live Setup:**

1. Download the .zip file and extract the **TakandthePowerofJujuBingo-V1.json** file
2. Navigate to https://beta.lockout.live/editor and select **Import JSON File**
3. Select the extracted .json file and click the **Play** button in the top-right corner
4. Customize your bingo settings and select **Load**

**Import Saves:**

2. Ensure your primary memory card is selected and click the **Import** button

4. Note that slot B will be the Bingo file with no teleporters/no crazy feet, and slot C will be the Bingo file with teleporters and crazy feet

## Bingo Save File Documentation:

This .zip file includes 2 save files that I thought would be nice "starting points" for a bingo playthrough. Both files already have the staff and spirit rattle collected, and the four mummies have been escorted to the ceremonial tomb for access to Spirit World. The third plant in LTV is missing 1/3 of its health as this is required for Spirit Rattle Early. Aside from this, I tried to influence the world as little as possible to provide a blank slate for a bingo playthrough. No feathers have been collected in either file. Here are all the changes made in both files including the reasoning for the change:

**BingoSaveB.sav.gci:**
- Imports into slot B
- Warrior Staff obtained
- Spirit Rattle obtained
- Spirit World opened
- Plant 3 in LTV missing 1/3 of health (Required for Spirit Rattle Early)

**BingoSaveAllPortalsAndCrazyFeetC.sav.gci:**
- Imports into slot C
- Warrior Staff obtained
- Spirit Rattle obtained
- Spirit World opened
- Plant 3 in LTV missing 1/3 of health (Required for Spirit Rattle Early)
- Tak's Village Tiki Collected (Required to obtain Crazy Feet)
- Dinky Juju Summoned (Required to obtain Crazy Feet)
- Sandboard Collected (Required to obtain Crazy Feet)
- Crazy Feet Collected
- Upper Tree Village gates both opened (Required to activate teleporters in UTV and MT)
- Sun Temple second room completed (Required to activate teleporter)
- Lower door by teleporter in Tak's Village opened (Required to leave teleporter area of TV)
- The following teleporters have been activated
    - Burial Grounds
    - Mummy Tombs
    - Lower Tree Village
    - Upper Tree Village
    - Mountain Top
    - Chicken Island
    - Chicken Island West

        - Excluded the following two teleporters:

            - Chicken Temple (Requires 100 yorbels, Lok's Spirit, and completing a little under half of Chicken Temple)
- A few skippable cutscenes have already been viewed, including in Sun Temple and Mountain Top
